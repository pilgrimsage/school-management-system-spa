# School Management System (SPA)

A CodeIgniter 4 school management system (admissions, attendance, fees,
exams, employee/HR, transport, academics) with a server-rendered login page
and an AJAX-driven "SPA" shell for the logged-in employee and student
portals.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** PHP / CodeIgniter 4, MySQL (MariaDB in production)
- **Frontend:** jQuery + a hand-rolled AJAX router (no framework — see below)
- **Auth:** JWT (`app/Filters/JWTAuthFilter.php`), applied globally to every
  route except an explicit skip-list (login, pre-login, forgot-password,
  privacy-policy, public fee receipts)

## The custom JS router

There is **no client-side routing library** in this project. Navigation
inside the logged-in portals is a hand-rolled AJAX router: `public/assets/js/spa-router.js`
exposes `window.SPARouter.init(options)`, and both portal shells

- `app/Views/portal/post-login-employee.php`
- `app/Views/portal/post-login-student.php`

call it with their own routes/plugin/customConfig data. This used to be
~1000 lines of `navigateTo()`/`AppState`/plugin-lifecycle/history-handling
code duplicated almost 1:1 in both files — a fix applied to one copy quietly
stayed broken in the other. That duplication is gone now; **if you're
debugging a navigation issue, start in `spa-router.js`**, not in the two
much smaller portal views (which are now just per-portal configuration) or
the PHP controllers.

Failure modes this router has already had (all fixed, all worth knowing
about since the pattern can recur):

- Browser back button doing nothing on the very first press (the initial
  page load never wrote a `history.pushState`/`replaceState` entry, so the
  first `popstate` had no `event.state` to act on).
- Navigation clicks silently dropped when they happened while another
  request was still in flight (the queued-navigation dequeue code existed
  but was commented out).
- The mobile hardware back button firing twice (Capacitor's `backButton`
  listener registered in two separate `DOMContentLoaded` blocks).
- A stray `document.addEventListener("backbutton", ...)` registered *inside*
  a chart-rendering function, so a new listener piled up every time that
  chart's route loaded, without ever being removed.

If you add a new page fragment that needs `navigateTo(...)` as a global
(some do, e.g. `exam-details.php`, `employee-details.js`), it's exposed on
`window` from inside `SPARouter.init()` — see the comment above its
definition in `spa-router.js`.

## Setup (clone and run locally)

1. `composer install`
2. Copy `env` to `.env` and set at minimum:
   - `app.baseURL`
   - `database.default.*` (hostname, database, username, password) — point
     it at an empty local MySQL/MariaDB database you've created, e.g.
     `CREATE DATABASE school_management_system;`
   - `JWT_SECRET` (required — `JWTAuthFilter` decodes every authenticated
     request with this; there is no fallback). Generate one with
     `php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(32));"`
3. `php spark migrate`
4. `php spark db:seed DatabaseSeeder`
5. `php spark serve` and log in with one of the demo accounts below

`index.php` lives in `public/`, not the project root — point your web
server's document root at `public/`.

### Database / migrations / seeders

`app/Database/Migrations` previously had no migrations at all even though
the production database has 39 tables — the schema only existed in the
live MySQL instance. A baseline migration
(`2026-09-24-000000_InitialSchema.php`) now reverse-engineers that schema
from a production dump, so a fresh environment can be provisioned with:

```
php spark migrate
php spark db:seed DatabaseSeeder
```

Add any further schema changes as new migrations on top of that baseline —
don't edit it in place.

`DatabaseSeeder` (`app/Database/Seeds/`) loads baseline lookup data (roles,
the admin "tools" tiles + role permissions, a couple of classes/sections/
subjects) plus four **fake, non-PII demo accounts** so you can actually log
in locally after a fresh clone:

| Login                    | Role       | Password       |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------|
| `admin@example.test`      | Admin      | `DemoPass!123` |
| `teacher@example.test`    | Teacher    | `DemoPass!123` |
| `accountant@example.test` | Accountant | `DemoPass!123` |
| `student@example.test`    | Student    | `DemoPass!123` |

Never run `DatabaseSeeder`/`DemoUsersSeeder` against production — it creates
these accounts with a published password.

### Auth notes

- Passwords are hashed with `password_hash()` on write. Older rows created
  before hashing was introduced are still plaintext; login verifies against
  either format and silently upgrades a plaintext row to a hash on
  successful login (see `BaseController::verifyAndUpgradePassword()`).
- Every route is behind the global `jwt` filter except the explicit
  skip-list in `JWTAuthFilter`. If you add a new route that should be
  public, add its first URI segment there rather than disabling the filter.

## Running the test suite

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

`tests/unit/` runs without a database. `tests/database/` (e.g.
`AuthLoginTest`, which logs in as each seeded demo account through the real
`/api/login` route) needs a **separate** MySQL/MariaDB database, because the
schema migration uses MySQL-specific DDL that CodeIgniter's SQLite3 test
default can't run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE school_management_system_test;
```

Then set in `.env` (see the commented block in `env` for the full copy —
note `database.tests.DBPrefix` is deliberately left **empty**, since
CodeIgniter's own default of `db_` for the tests group doesn't work against
raw-SQL migrations like this project's):

```
database.tests.hostname = 127.0.0.1
database.tests.database = school_management_system_test
database.tests.username = root
database.tests.password =
database.tests.DBDriver = MySQLi
database.tests.DBPrefix =
```

`AuthLoginTest` migrates and seeds this database automatically on each run
(`DatabaseTestTrait`) — it's disposable, drop and recreate it any time.

## Server requirements

PHP 8.1+, with the `intl`, `mbstring`, `json`, and `mysqlnd` extensions
enabled.

## Repository structure

- `app/Controllers/Web/*ModulePages` — page controllers that render the
  fragments the AJAX router swaps into `#app`
- `app/Controllers/Data` — business logic / data access, called from the
  Web controllers
- `app/Views/portal` — the two SPA shells described above
- `app/Views/pages` — the individual page fragments loaded into the shells
